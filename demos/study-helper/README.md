# Study Helper Application

This is a simple AutoGen demo for people who are curious about a basic application of AutoGen! I made it to learn how to use AutoGen myself. This was my way of figuring it out and now that it works (somehow), I thought it might be useful for others too. Plus I love flashcards :)

StudyHelper uses AutoGen to create a group chat between AI agents.

1. Research Agent generates the 'raw' research material for the other agents to use
2. Flashcard Agent creates flashcards based on the research from Research Agent
3. Recommendation Agent creates a study guide

The front end then displays the information.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Azure OpenAI API access
- Flask (web framework)
- AutoGen library

My recommendation, if you're not confident, is to use Visual Studio Code as it's the one that I use in the video so is probably easier to follow along with.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd study-helper
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

You need to have your own Azure OpenAI API credentials (key & endpoint & deployment name - [here is a guide on it if you're unsure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/model-inference/concepts/endpoints?tabs=python)).  You need to set the following environment variables:

### On Windows

#### Command Prompt
```
set AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://[your_resource_name].openai.azure.com/
set AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=[your_deployment_name]
```

#### PowerShell
```
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://[your_resource_name].openai.azure.com/"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="[your_deployment_name]"
```

### On macOS/Linux

```
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here
export AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=your_deployment_name_here
```

- Please note I've only tested the PowerShell method, the others should be fine though.

## Running the App (the fun part)

1. Make sure you're in the root folder and then run:
   ```
   python web_app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and pop this in the address bar:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. Enter a study topic (it can be anything!) and then press the button. After a short wait you'll see your study materials generated!


## Important Notes + Troubleshooting
- If you get an error about missing API credentials, please double-check that you configured your environment variables correctly (check the Configuration step above).
- Be careful about changing code_execution_config to True in the demo as this can cause unintended effects if you run it on your machine - please only do that if you know what you're doing. You can also learn about it to make sure you're doing it safely. [Here is the Autogen documentation on this](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/docs/tutorial/code-executors/) which also goes over how to run it in a Docker container to keep your machine safe.
- Please note the front-end (JavaScript, CSS, HTML) was generated by GitHub Copilot.
- The Sequential Workflow pattern may have been better for this, but it was my first time learning AutoGen! If you want to create your own similar project, maybe look into using that pattern instead. On the plus side it was fun learning how the Group Chat design pattern works and getting it to work around it.

Handy if you want to have a play with making your own agents (I also recommend asking AI itself for prompting guidance - for example "I want an agent that does Task A and an agent that does Task B, what's a good prompt to give them in my app?" Doesn't have to be groundbreaking!)
