# Multi-Agent Orchestration Tips

Please note this is still a work-in-progress.

## 1. What is this guide 
- Overview
- Guide purpose
- Audience

## 2. What is Multi-Agent Orchestration?

### 2.1 Core ideas

- Definition / core concepts

### 2.2 Benefits

- multi-agent systems vs single-agent AI

### 2.3 Use cases/applications
- Real world examples

### 2.4 Important components
- Comms protocols (FIPA-ACL/direct messaging/shared memory etc.)
- coordination mechanisms (leader-follower model etc.)
- Decision-making models (rule-based, BDI, reinforcement learning etc.)
- scalability issues? 

## 3. Key technology

| **Technology** | **Description** | **Use in Multi-Agent Orchestration** |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| M365 SDK |   |   |
| Semantic Kernel |   |  |
| AutoGen |   |   |

| [Multi-Agent Research Demo](https://github.com/groveale/agent-tips/tree/main/demos/multi-agent-research) (If you are looking at this from the temporary multi-agent branch: [Multi-Agent Research Demo](https://github.com/groveale/agent-tips/tree/multi-agent/demos/multi-agent-research)) | Practical demonstration of orchestrating three specialised agents (Research, Summariser, Recommender) to process research queries sequentially | Recommended for understanding basic multi-agent orchestration |

### 5. Implementation

This part should cover:

- How to segment something into multiple agents, deciding what each one does, interaction with each other etc
- Orchestration patterns (central orchestrator, decentralised messaging, hierarchicall/leader-agent structure etc.)
- Some example implementations
